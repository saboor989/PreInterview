Hi Ramone Ray,

As requested solved the pre-interview Program , 
you can open in eclipse and run the program.

1. The first program wrote the solution for the example data you provided.
     For it to be easy for testing I hard coded the value and tested. you can change the array values and test it, 
     output will be printed on the console.
2. Wrote the solution as wanted, used the .csv file to read the data and calculate the social analysis problem, 
    It is also the stand alone program. 
    To execute the program you first have to copy the .csv file on your desktop and change the url in the program 
    so that the program read the data from the file. 
    To make it easy and faster I didn't use the JUnit test, instead it is also an stand alone program you can change 
    the values in the .csv file and test it. 
    
    The solutions are small functions so didn't use Java Objects and make it a big solutions.
    if implemented using the java Objects, I had to implement the object oriented solution, and writing unit tests using Junit 
    to test the solution. and to declare and implemented interface for the methods.

I will be waiting for your response. 

Thanks
Saboor
